# Welcome!

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

## Task Overview

### 1. Titanic Survival Detection

**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python

**Description:** In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.

### 3. Iris Flower Classification

**Description:** The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

### 4. Sales Prediction using Python

**Description:** This project focuses on predicting sales for a business. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model to forecast future sales.

### 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Description:** In the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project addresses class imbalance, preprocesses data, and uses logistic regression for classification.
